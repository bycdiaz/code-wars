# Take an array and remove every second element out of that array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

# Example:

# my_arr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]

# None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

my_arr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
